Sentig Project Mapper
Sentig Project Mapper is a versatile tool that scans a directory structure, generates a detailed directory map, and prints the content of specific file types. It filters files based on size (e.g., skipping files larger than 1MB) and excludes hidden files and directories. The output includes a comprehensive overview of the directory layout and the contents of selected files, making it perfect for quick project insights.

Available in both Python and PHP versions, it's easy to integrate into any workflow.
